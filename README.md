# Timer
Before the lack of a proper timer -easy to install and use- for speedruns in Mac I have decided to train my programming skills by creating my own.

I will add a set of milestones with characteristics I want my timer to have to be a complete one and to mark my progress there.

- Working timer with cs precision (done)
- Split Functionality
- Personalized background
- Sync database with Speedrun.com or similar
- Reading and writing times to save PBs and compare times with previous runs.
